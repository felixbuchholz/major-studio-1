country-neighbours
==================
A very simple and unsophisticated script to retrieve all of the neighbors for all the countries in the world.

##Usage
Just use the neighbors.json file.

If an update needs to be done, or if you need to have the same data in some other way, use the index.html

###neighbors-modified.json

This file contains a slightly modified version of the worlds countries, with modifications made to european part. I've made some modification to islands and Kosovo,
 which are by no means official and are wholly my doing. Use with caution.

**NB!**
Remember to replace the `username` with your geoname.org username, if you use the `index.html` file
