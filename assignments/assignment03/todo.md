# Until tomorrow

- style the radio buttons. 
- Connect slider and map again.
  - setting during animation works! – Make it less present during that, and after the animation is finished, use the slider to filter by year. 

- Hover Population, GDP, Region, etc. – only available after animation -> roll them in
- Hover for the graphs (comparison within graph!)
- Read & write about Ghana and make the small graphs
- ~Make the navigation vanish and the dashboard pop up in sequence~ !! // Don’t do that, change the landing page layout instead
- Current Year BOLD BIG next to the Interface

# bonus: 
- Deactivate button up / down when end of range

# style 
- CSS clean fuels acces is now a button!


# Dashboard of dashboards:
- Mobile-view





## Done (only after 20181206)
- Make another y-Axis option to include countries under 4 % access //
- CSS toggle switch: SDG focus, plain
- Enable the map view

## Decided against
- Show also the high and low, when hovering over a country
- Dashboard sorting 
- Use ISO-Code on backend instead of countryname // not for now :) // Would be better next time!
- On jumping to next country: compare two countries
- // .transition().duration(pointTimer)
  // .style('font-size', '12px')
  // .style('fill', 'rgb(0, 0, 0)')
